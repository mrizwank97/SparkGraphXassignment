# SparkGraphXassignment

This is a hands-on about distributed graphs. 

We use Spark GraphX for distributed processing in the Spark ecosystem and, additionally, we introduce the Spark Graph Frames. GraphX is a component of Spark for graphs and graph-parallel computation, providing a collection of graph algorithms (e.g., Page Rank,
Triangle Counting and Connected Components) and some fundamental operations on graphs based on TLAV. Relevantly, GraphX implements an optimized variant of the Pregel API
(most popular implementation of the TLAV programming model), which is a popular graph processing system developed by Google in 2010. 

Environment setup: Intellij
